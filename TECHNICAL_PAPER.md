2. **Memory Bottlenecks**: Large language models (4B-70B+ parameters) consume 8GB-140GB+ of VRAM, limiting accessibility
3. **Single-Threaded Bottlenecks**: Traditional architectures fail to utilize available CPU cores efficiently

### 1.2 Revolutionary Solution

LoneStar DI IDE introduces a paradigm shift through:

- **Massive CPU Parallelization**: 108,000+ nanobots eliminate GPU dependency
- **CodeDI Compression**: 4:1 to 10:1 compression ratios with compressed execution capability
- **Distributed Intelligence**: 3-agent system with specialized processing pipelines
